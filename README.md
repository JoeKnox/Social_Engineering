Built this little email and credential harvest using Kali Linux and ChatGPT

Basically, once connected to the network, it is super easy to harvest credentials from a phishing email produced by ChatGPT, a sense of urgency and a recognized name.
Essentially, using a fake email with a sense of Urgency, Trust and Familiarity, it would seem easy to target the ill-informed.   This is why training staff and people is always important.

Keeping in mind that there are several downfalls within this.  I did not but could have created a false email account- I could have used an email service like Mail Channels but did not - it does not work with current installs of Chrome b/c it only wants to load HTTPS formats and I had not created or cloned a SSL Certificate, but it does work with Firefox- you do have to be connected to the local subnet with the credential harvester- 


For this Project, I used ChatGPT, Google, NMAP, Kali Linux, Windows, various email accounts and the Social Engineering Toolkit within Kali Linux
