Built this little email and credential harvest using Kali Linux and ChatGPT

Basically, once connected to the network, it is super easy to harvest credentials from a phishing email produced by ChatGPT, a sense of urgency and a recognized name.
Essentially, using a fake email with a sense of Urgency, Trust and Familiarity, it would seem easy to target the ill-informed.   This is why training staff and people is always important.


For this Project, I used ChatGPT, Google, NMAP, Kali Linux, Windows, various email accounts and the Social Engineering Toolkit within Kali Linux
